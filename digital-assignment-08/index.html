<h2>Bacon's Bacon Delivery</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A piece of bacon goes around collecting other pieces of bacon. The player must pay attention to the smaller bacon bits following the player character in order to solve platforming puzzles (in theory).
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I spent a long time trying to get the bacon pieces to follow the player in a reasonable way; it somewhat works. I have multiple music tracks that are timed to be in sync with one another. I created moving platforms that the player is expected to interact with. I have collision cases that don't rely on Phaser's built-in collision detection, due to its limitations. I also have several flair animations to make the game feel a little bit more alive, including basic and silly animations for the player character and the followers.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
For this prototype, I already had some basic mechanics and gameplay implemented, but these mechanics were not functioning the way I wanted them to. I attempted to implement the follower mechanics in the way that I wanted, but I ended up somewhat breaking the game more, even though the game logic is closer to where I want it to be. I also tried to implement a dash (bound to Q) but was unable to get a timer working on the dash, so it's a little broken right now as well. I should have focused on implementing mechanics correctly from the beginning rather than using quick fixes.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li>Follower algorithms based heavily on <a href = "https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/snake">Snake Phaser Example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Bacon finds and delivers bacon against the clock to a frying pan.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Strong influence of bacon
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Players must deal with moving platforms and dangerous jumps. It's intended that they also must contend with enemies and be careful that they do not lose their follower bacon pieces. The platforming and puzzles the player faces will change based on how many other pieces of bacon the player has collected.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is focused on evaluating the follower mechanic alongside platforming.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel the need to adjust their gameplay and approach to puzzles based on the number of followers they have.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players control Bacon with the arrow keys. Left and Right move Bacon in those directions, and Up may be used to jump. The bacon bits will follow your actions. Players must collect all the pieces and deliver them to the frying pan in order to complete the stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players being mindful of how their chain of followers is affected by their actions will be most successful.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Bacon's one goal in life is to be part of a tasty breakfast, but his friends are always causing trouble. Bacon by himself isn't a meal, but maybe if he gathers a few buddies, he could be one. Bacon must race against the clock to become part of the ultimate fatty breakfast.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	Players that enjoy puzzle platforming games, or are very interested in bacon.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes.
