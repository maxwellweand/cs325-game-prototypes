# GMU CS325 Introduction to Game Design

This repository contains all of the digital games made for my CS325 class as well as a few simple "hello, world!"
templates for games made with Phaser. These games are written in Javascript using the [Phaser 2](https://phaser.io/) game framework. 

You can try out these games directly on GitHub here: [https://maxwellweand.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/](https://maxwellweand.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/)
