    <h2>Shooty Each Other</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            Very few commercial multiplayer games similar to this exist. Players must focus on navigating
            through simple, but dynamic bullet patterns generated by the enemy.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            Two players play on one screen. Players have separate timers for their rate of fire, and bullets have an
            eight frame animation. Text is displayed dynamically based on in-game conditions.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            This prototype was a learning experience in many ways, especially because of my inexperience using
            JavaScript. I had to figure out how to get the kinds of collisions I wanted with the physics engine, how to
            manage and display player health dynamically, and how to generate bullets for each player in a way that felt
            natural.
            The hardest part of this prototype was in figuring out how to get every physics collision working properly.
            I had to learn a lot about Phaser in order to implement the type of physics I wanted and I think it will be
            much easier in the future.

        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
            The closest game I know of is <i>Touhou Genso Rondo: Bullet Ballet</i>. I have never played this game. My
            game borrows some of its logic (particularly bullet generation and text display) from the Phaser example, <a
                    href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/invaders">Invaders</a>.
        </li>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            Two players control combating ships, moving and firing upon one another until one player's HP reaches zero.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            Two futuristic spaceships have a battle to the death.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            The variety in this game comes from players reacting to different situations differently. The goal of the
            game is to shoot at each other, but the strategies to avoid bullets is highly dependent on position in the
            game and how the player chooses to navigate between enemy shots.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            This game is trying to create strong, dynamic gameplay on a single screen. This prototype tests whether
            player interaction can drive the dynamicness of the game entirely.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            I want players to experience experience exciting action gameplay, and feel that they are competing against
            another person. They should be paying attention to both the movement of the enemy player, and how to best
            dodge the incoming bullets.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            Players can move while simultaneously adjusting their ship's rotation, allowing for complex angles of
            attack. Player 1 strafes by using WASD and controls rotation with J and L, while firing with K. Player 2
            strafes by using the arrow keys, and controls rotation with 4 and 6 on the numpad, while firing with 5 on
            the numpad. The game ends after one player's HP reaches zero, as displayed in the top corners of the game.
            In future versions of this game, destroyable walls should be implemented to allow players to take temporary
            cover and jockey for position.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            Moving towards your shots will cluster your bullets into a smaller space, so moving toward your opponent
            when you have a good lock is a good way to deal a lot of damage. For beginners, it might be best to focus on
            dodging bullets, rather than attacking accurately.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            The pilot of the player 1 ship, Blue, is the sworn enemy of the pilot of the player 2 ship, Red. Hailing
            from the same hometown, they have been at odds ever since the days of their youth. Now, both members of
            opposing factions in the Great Space War, they have been both been waiting for a moment of isolation such as
            this to engage in a deadly duel!
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            People interested in quick, competitive games that are mechanically simple.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            ~2 minutes
        </li>
