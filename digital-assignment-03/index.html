<h2>Slippery Seal Romance</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Seals are at best semi-popular, so a seal-focused game is highly original. 'Ice block puzzles' are usually only small minigames within larger games, but I think making complicated ice block puzzles into a complete game could be fun. Furthermore, there is seal romance involving fish delivery, which is certainly original.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Players lose control of their character after inputting an action while on ice. They keep going in their last direction until hitting a wall.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This prototype taught me that game states can cause variables to be very difficult to access. It's extremely important to have a good code/program layout as well as a game layout. The hardest part of this prototype was trying to get the rosefish to flag the game as endable. I never figured this out, and compromised by instead having the player seal eat the rosefish and give his girlfriend a hug.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The code is either completely original or adapted from the template below.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate confusing ice-laden passages to find the perfect anniversary rose fish!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of anniversary. It's your seal anniversary with your seal girlfriend.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
	Players control a seal that slips on ice and makes typical movement impossible.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
	This prototype evaluates the seal movement and fish eating mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
	I want players to feel rewarded for overcoming spatial puzzles, as well as for keeping a relationship for at least a year.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the arrow keys to set off in a direction, and cannot change their movement until they collide with something and come to a stop. Players must navigate to the rose fish, and then deliver it to seal girlfriend, saving their anniversary date.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Projecting your seal position several moves ahead is very valuable in this type of game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's your anniversary! Seal has had a busy day at work, and it's finally time to get something nice for your seal girlfriend. The slippery frozen tundra is filled with obstructions and you must navigate them to obtain the rosefish, symbol of sealy romance! Though, if you don't get it, I don't think seal girlfriend would mind that much.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone that enjoys strategic spacial puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
2-3 minutes
</li>
