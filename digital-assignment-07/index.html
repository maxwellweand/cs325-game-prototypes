<h2>Bacon's Bacon Delivery</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A piece of bacon goes around collecting other pieces of bacon. The player must pay attention to the smaller bacon bits following the player character in order to solve platforming puzzles (in theory).
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I spent a long time trying to get the bacon pieces to follow the player in a reasonable way; it somewhat works. I have multiple music tracks that are timed to be in sync with one another. I created moving platforms that the player is expected to interact with. I have collision cases that don't rely on Phaser's built-in collision detection, due to its limitations. I also have several flair animations to make the game feel a little bit more alive, even though the main character is not animated.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I knew I had to create a lot of art assets, and that the main mechanics involving follower units would be somewhat tedious to implement. I decided to skip out on animating the main characters and forego adding enemy units to just focus on getting the follower physics down. I ended up trying many different solutions and this was the best result, though it is still not satisfactory for a complete game. I picked this sort of mechanic because I thought it was within the scope of a multi-week project, so I intend to implement it fully by the next iteration. Focusing on mechanics rather than aesthetics might have been more important for developing the game.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li>Follower algorithms based heavily on <a href = "https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/snake">Snake Phaser Example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Bacon finds and delivers bacon against the clock to a frying pan.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Strong influence of bacon
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Players must deal with moving platforms and dangerous jumps. It's intended that they also must contend with enemies and be careful that they do not lose their follower bacon pieces. The platforming and puzzles the player faces will change based on how many other pieces of bacon the player has collected.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype is focused on evaluating the follower mechanic alongside platforming.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel the need to adjust their gameplay and approach to puzzles based on the number of followers they have.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players control Bacon with the arrow keys. Left and Right move Bacon in those directions, and Up may be used to jump. The bacon bits will follow your actions. Players must collect all the pieces and deliver them to the frying pan in order to complete the stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players being mindful of how their chain of followers is affected by their actions will be most successful.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Bacon's one goal in life is to be part of a tasty breakfast, but his friends are always causing trouble. Bacon by himself isn't a meal, but maybe if he gathers a few buddies, he could be one. Bacon must race against the clock to become part of the ultimate fatty breakfast.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
	Players that enjoy puzzle platforming games, or are very interested in bacon.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes.
