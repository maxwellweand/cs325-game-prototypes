<h2>Marshmallow Delivers</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Have you ever wondered what it's like to live life as a Starship delivery robot? With this game, I have invented a completely accurate simulation of what it's like to deliver goods to consumers that would be better off going to the store and
    getting it themselves. Never before has technology allowed us to experience GMU campus at its fullest and most fantastical. Join Marshmallow on his journey through campus to find the only glasses of water around - the only glasses that can rehydrate the mariachi band - the only mariachi band that
    drown out the noise from constant construction. I have never seen this dehydrated mariachi band on campus, but I dream of it every time I see the ruins of Robinson A. Because they only appear in my dreams, and my dreams are extremely original,
    it follows that this game based around them is also original. Also, if anyone playing this is interested in writing a fanfiction, they are dehydrated due to fibrotic lung disease, not overplaying. This is also very original.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    This game has the greatest number of assets of any game I've made so far, by a long shot. My limiting factor in adding mechanics (of which several more were planned) was certainly in the time it takes to make all the art assets. Tilemaps are loaded from a painstakingly created json file, and the map itself is a recreation of GMU campus surrounding the JC. Key items and objectives had to be tracked independently. I made three separate audio tracks to represent the different
    instruments in the band. These audio tracks had to be timed together and muted/unmuted dynamically in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    In this prototype I intended to implement all the mechanics I had either failed to implement before for one reason or another. I started by trying to incorporate tile maps and collisions with the map. I also wanted to create a 'key and lock' item scheme that I failed to successfully implement before. I had dynamic audio that looped, which I wanted to implement in previous games, but did not have the time to.
    The asset creation was the most time-consuming part of this game, and going forward I need to be very careful about the asset requirements my ideas have.

    <li>everything else: original</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I started by using the template-tilemap provided to us, but it exists now as only a few lines. My code is otherwise original.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Become the bard of bards, Marshmallow, and revitalize those that revitalize us in this tale of drama and dehydration.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of 'glasses'. Marshmallow delivers glasses of waters to dehydrated mariachi band members around GMU campus.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The glasses are placed semi-randomly and will force players to do a bit of exploring in order to complete the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is trying to evaluate whether simple exploration incentives are enough to encourage players to explore the entire map.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel like they are a Starship delivery robot.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Control Marshmallow by using the arrow keys. Up and down accelerate Marshmallow forwards and backwards. Left and right turn Marshmallow. Collect the water glasses laying around the map and deliver them to the mariachi band, so that they can help liven up the campus.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players that explore the map completely should be able to reap the reward of the nice song at the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Oh no! The entire campus is under construction and asbestos is to blame. The mariachi band members are the only ones that can drown out the sickening racket of construction, but they are completely parched. Marshmallow, YOU must find the glasses of water laying around campus and deliver them to the mariachi band! You're the only one with such delivery capabilities!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any GMU student that understands the current state of affairs.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
~5 minutes
