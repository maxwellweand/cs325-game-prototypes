<h2>Marshmallow Delivers</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Have you ever wondered what it's like to live life as a Starship delivery robot? With this game, I have invented a completely accurate simulation of what it's like to deliver goods to consumers that would be better off going to the store and
    getting it themselves. Never before has technology allowed us to experience GMU campus at its fullest and most fantastical. Join Marshmallow on his journey through campus to find the only glasses of water around - the only glasses that can rehydrate the mariachi band - the only mariachi band that
    drown out the noise from constant construction. I have never seen this dehydrated mariachi band band on campus, but I dream of it every time I see the ruins of Robinson A. Because they only appear in my dreams, and my dreams are extremely original,
    it follows that this game based around them is also original. Also, if anyone playing this is interested in writing a fanfiction, they are dehydrated due to fibrotic lung disease, not overplaying. This is also an original reason.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    This game has the greatest number of assets of any game I've made so far, by a long shot. My limiting factor in adding mechanics (of which several more were planned) was certainly in the time it takes to make all the art assets. Tilemaps are loaded from a painstakingly created json file, and the map itself is a recreation of GMU campus surrounding the JC. Key items and objectives had to be tracked independently.

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    In this prototype I intended to implement all the mechanics I had either failed to implement before, or was

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Become the bard of bards, Marshmallow, and revitalize those that revitalize us in this tale of drama and dehydration.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of 'glasses'. Marshmallow delivers glasses of waters to dehydrated mariachi band members around GMU campus.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
